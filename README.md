# Python-Workbook
It contains the exercise in python which are worked by me.  
It also contains errors and solution faced during the coding.  
It might help newbie  to find where they may make a mistake during their coding.  
It might help me/someone to register the newbie mistake during their publication of book/articles.(like **learn python the hard way**)

Idea copied from nitstorm :-)
